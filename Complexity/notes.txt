Time Complexity - the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm.

Space Complexity - includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input, the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution.

Primarily there are three types of Asymptotic notations to represent complexity:

Big-Oh (O) notation - Worst Case
Big Omega (Ω) notation - Best Case
Big Theta (Θ) notation - Average Case

recurrence relation of 2 types:
Linear - like fibonacci
divide and conquer - like merge sort

to find complexity we can use :
Masters Theorem 
Akra Bazzi Theorem
